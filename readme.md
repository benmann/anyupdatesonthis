## Any updates on this?

If you’re involved with Open Source projects and/or ended up here because you asked the above question, please take some time think about it.

Open Source maintainers often have hundreds of open issues at the same time. Giving feedback to all of those questions is a lot of work and asking them doesn’t add any value. No feedback on an issue or pull request is a clear indicator for it being blocked (for whatever reason).

Instead of asking for updates, think of ways to help out and offer to get things done to the best of your abilities.
