      If you’re involved with Open Source projects and/or ended up  here because you asked the above question, please take some time think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Source maintainers often have hundreds of open issues at the same time. Giving feedback to all of those questions is a lot of work and asking them doesn’t add any value. No feedback on an issue or pull request is a clear indicator for it being blocked (for whatever reason).
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of asking for updates, think of ways to help out and offer to get things done to the best of your abilities.
